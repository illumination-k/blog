# About Me

Hi, I am a Ph.D. student majoring in plant molecular biology in [Laboratory of Plant Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University](http://www.plantmb.lif.kyoto-u.ac.jp). My research themes are to develop the expression database and elucidate the gibberellin system in the basal land plant, the liverwort *Marchantia polymorpha*. I love both biology and programing, especially bioinformatics. I have skills both of “wet” and “dry”.

In biology, I am interested in the evolution, development, and omics analysis of plants.
In programming, I am interested in machine learning and web development.
